- Create a branch locally and make your changes. Feel free to reach us if you need a code review before you finish your work

## Contributing to the code

Once done with the changes, run the test suite. It will run existing test cases, check coverage, run `black` and `mypy`.
Also, make sure you have updated the documentation, added required test cases and modified the `changelog.md` file
in `docs` directory before creating the PR

## Contributing to the documentation

We are using the amazing [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) library for documentation. You can spin up the mkdocs live debugging server
from the root of the repository and see the changes you are making in realtime. 


<div class="termy">

```console
$ mkdocs serve
